# Playing Tiger's Game
- arrow keys move up/down/left/right

# Completed
+ Setup SBT project
+ Added ligGDX 
+ added textures for tiger and locations (cave, prey, mate, plain grass)
+ added grid code to display game layout
+ tiger base stats (satiety, health, energy, intelligence)
+ Basic background sound ambiance

# TODO
- tiger base actions (sleep, hunt, mate, observe, move)
- tiger base flavor text
- intelligence benchmarks (carry items, use tools, acquire resources, discover fire, etc)
- tiger intermediate stats (self-esteem, actualization, self-efficacy, depression, anxiety, these are just ideas?)
- tiger intermediate actions (carry, use, craft, skin, chop, plant, capture, feed animal, etc)
- tiger intermediate flavor text
- add textures for advanced tiles (trees, fireplace, farm, animal pen, etc)
- tiger sounds when performing actions
- create sense of ennui as the life of the tiger gets more complex, etc (example: basic sleep text for base, but as intermediate/advanced happens, the sleep text changes to something more profound, such as "To sleep, perchance to dream- ay, there's the rub")

# FAQ

## Q) Is there a goal in "A Tiger's Game"?
A) The game comes with no stated goal; it only observes and displays one's actions. You must take meaning into what these observations represent.
